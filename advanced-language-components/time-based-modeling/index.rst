Time-Based Modeling
===================

In AIMMS there are three fundamental building blocks for time-based
modeling namely *horizons*, *calendars* and *timetable-based aggregation
and disaggregation*. These concepts coincide with your natural view of
time, but there are associated details that need to be examined. Using
these building blocks, you can develop time-dependent model-based
applications with substantially less effort than would otherwise be
required.
