Execution Statements
====================

This chapter describes the interaction between the nonprocedural and
procedural execution mechanisms in AIMMS. In addition, the major
execution statements like the assignment statement, the flow control
statements, and the ``OPTION`` statement are discussed. Other important
execution statements such as procedure calls, the ``SOLVE`` statement,
as well as data control and display statements are discussed in various
other chapters.
